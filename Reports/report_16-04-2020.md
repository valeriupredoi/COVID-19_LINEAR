# Three weeks of lockdown in the UK

## Abstract

We show a brief comparison of the numbers on March 22, one day before
the lockdown was instituted in the UK, and on April 16, the day when
a further three weeks of lockdown were announced. Model and other sets
of results are presented in the other reports [here](https://github.com/valeriupredoi/COVID-19_LINEAR/tree/master/Reports).

## March 22 - April 16, 2020

UK: March 22         |  UK: April 16

**Figure 1** Comparison of reported number of cases (red dots) and reported in-hospital deaths for March 22 (left) and April 16 (right);
a set of predictions highlighted in dotted green lines (best case) and dotted black lines (worst case) are shown.

Date   | Reported cases | Reported Deaths | Doubling T Cases (days) | Doubling T Deaths (days) | R | Prct. Pop. (M=1%)
:-----:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------:|:------------------------:|:---:|:--------------:
22/03  | 5683 | 281 | 2.8 | 2.0 | 3 | 0.7%
16/04  | 103093 | 13729 | 8.6 | 10.8 | 0.8 | 3.2%
16/04(S)  | 690000 | 34000 | 3.5 | 3.5 | 2.2 | 80%

**Table 1** Comparison of different parameters on March 22 and on April 16 (actual numbers and simulated numbers;
(S) for simulated); parameters are: reported number of cases, in-hospital number of deaths, doubling times (T)
in days for reported cases and deaths, R (reproductive number for a 10 days infectious period, computed as
`R = exp(b) - 1` where `b` is the to-date growth rate for reported infections, percentage of population
(for a fixed fatality M=1%, full explanation in [report](https://github.com/valeriupredoi/COVID-19_LINEAR/blob/master/Reports/report_11-04-2020.md), numbers in [daily tables](https://github.com/valeriupredoi/COVID-19_LINEAR/tree/master/country_tables));
simulated numbers for 16/04(S) assume no lockdown and a constant exponential growth rate for cases and deaths
at 0.2 day-1 (daily growth) equivalent to a multiplying factor of `exp(0.2 x 24)` equal to 121.5 for 24 days,
from March 22 to April 16. The constant growth rate 0.2 day-1 is the most plausible rate for the UK in-hospital
counted infections before lockdown and is reflected in the [**continuation of Figure 1**(left)](https://github.com/valeriupredoi/COVID-19_LINEAR/blob/master/anciliaries/country_plots_03-2020/uk_evolution_20-03_31-03_2020/31-03.png) to March 31, as the growth rate for deaths between
March 21 and March 31 when recorded deaths were increasing at a non-lockdown pace, with infections causing them
being offset in time by 10-20 days.
