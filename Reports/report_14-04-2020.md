## Estimating the actual start of the infection in the UK

### Resources and New Findings
 - ONS [report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending3april2020#main-points) and FT [followup](https://www.ft.com/content/99220450-b0f2-4779-a768-90d199d1348c?fbclid=IwAR0yVcflr0wwfD4pyIqjqGiXl_YLqFR8TtXZcepi8UoAU-tlaZFFWQIcV3Y)
- Main finding: virus-related deaths, as reported by the ONS, are, on average 50%
  higher than the ones reported by health services

### Data
UK evolution in March
![march](https://github.com/valeriupredoi/COVID-19_LINEAR/blob/master/anciliaries/country_plots_03-2020/uk_evolution_20-03_31-03_2020/31-03.png)

**Key points:**

- constant daily increase rate for deaths between 21/03 and 31/03 at 20% (0.2 day-1);
- 1789 deaths on 31 March (as reported by health services) -> 2700 in actuality (corrected for by ONS
  reporting)
- assume fatality M=[0.5, 1, 2]% and delay of 10, 14 and 20 days:
- Compute delayed-projected cases `C(M)` using:

```
C(M, Delay) = 2700 x 1/M x 1/exp(0.2 x Delay)   (1)
```

- Compute time from initial `Ci` to 100 and to 3 cases using:

```
t100 = ln(Ci(M=1%, Delay=14)/100)/0.2   (2a)
```
and
```
t3 = ln(Ci(M=1%, Delay=14)/3)/0.2   (2b)
```

### Results

Table 1: we use equation (1) to obtain actual cases `C(M)` for different `M` and delays `Delay`.
We list the actual date `Act. Date` when the number of cases `C(M=1%)` was officially reported.
We notice a delay of reporting the actual cases of 8-11 days (in other words, the reported cases of today were
the actual cases 8-11 days ago).

Delay  | C(M=0.5%) | C(M=1%) | C(M=2%) | Act. Date
:-----:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|-----------:
10 days (21 Mar) | 73000 | 36500 | 18250 | 29 Mar
14 days (17 Mar) | `Ci`=32800 | `Ci`=16400 | `Ci`=8200 | 28 Mar
20 days (11 Mar) | 9900 | 4950 | 2500 | 21 Mar

Table 2: we use equations (2a) and (2b) to find the dates when there were 100 and 3 actual cases
(using `Ci` from Table 1, row Delay=14 days); like in Table 1, we also list the date `Act. Date` when 100 and 3
cases were reported.

Simulated No. cases | Date(M=0.5%) | Date(M=1%) | Date(M=2%) | Act. Date
:------------------:|:------------:|:----------:|:----------:|-----------:
100 cases (Delay=14) | 17 Feb | 21 Feb | 02 Mar    | 05 Mar |
3 cases (Delay=14) | 31 Jan  | 04 Feb | 13 Feb | 06 Feb |

### Conclusions

- The first three cases were reported in the UK on 06 February, 2020; the estimated
  actual number of cases for 04 February is 3 (considering a fatality
  of 1% and a delay between onset of infection and death of 14 days, a constant exponential
  daily increase rate of 0.2 day-1). This gives a delta of 2 days between the reported date and
  estimated date using our model; we consider this to be a plausible time delta for such a small number of cases;
- The first 100 cases were reported on 05 March; our model (M=1%, Delay=14 days) places a date for an actual
  number of cases of 100 at around 02 March; if this were tru, on 05 March there would already be 182 cases
  so the underreporting would already be 82% (missed detections);
- The ONS-adjusted death figures are in good accord with an onset of the epidemic in the first week of February (free transmission)
  and provide evidence that a fatality-delay pair of 1%-14 days is a plausible set of parameters.
