## Estimating the actual start of the infection in the UK

### Resources and New Findings
 - ONS [report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending3april2020#main-points) and FT [followup](https://www.ft.com/content/99220450-b0f2-4779-a768-90d199d1348c?fbclid=IwAR0yVcflr0wwfD4pyIqjqGiXl_YLqFR8TtXZcepi8UoAU-tlaZFFWQIcV3Y)
- Main finding: virus-related deaths, as reported by the ONS, are, on average 50%
  higher than the ones reported by health services

### Data
UK evolution in March
![march](https://github.com/valeriupredoi/COVID-19_LINEAR/blob/master/anciliaries/country_plots_03-2020/uk_evolution_20-03_31-03_2020/31-03.png)

**Key points:**

- constant daily increase rate for deaths between 21/03 and 31/03 at 20% (0.2 day-1);
- 1789 deaths on 31/03 (as reported by health services) -> 2700 in actuality (corrected for by ONS
  reporting)
- assume fatality M=[0.5, 1, 2]% and delay of 10, 14 and 20 days:

 Delay  | C(M=0.5%) | C(M=1%) | C(M=2%) | Act. C  | Testing eff(M=1%)
:------:|:--------:|:------:|:-------- :|--------:|:---------------:
10 days (21 Mar) | 73,000 | 36,500 | 18,250 | 5,018 | 14%
14 days (17 Mar) | 32,800 | 16,400 | 8,200 | 1,950 | 12%
20 days (11 Mar) | 9,900 | 4,950 | 2,500 | 456 | 9%

Simulated No. cases | Date(M=0.5%) | Date(M=1%) | Date(M=2%) | Act. Date
:------:|:--------:|:------:|:-------- :|--------:
100 cases (M=1%, delay=14) | 17 Feb | 21 Feb | 25 Feb    | 05 Mar |
3 cases (M=1%, delay=14) | 1 Feb  | 08 Feb | 15 Feb | 06 Feb |

Compte delayed-projected cases using:
```
C = 2700 x 1/M x 1/exp(0.2 x delay)
```
The first three cases were reported in the UK on 06 February, 2020.
The estimated actual cases for 08 February, 2020, is 3 (considering a fatality
of 1% and a delay between onset of infection and death of 14 days, a constant exponential
daily increase rate of 0.2 day-1). Testing efficiency for that result would be 100%.
